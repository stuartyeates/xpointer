xpointer
========

a ruby xpointer implementation

my first attemt to write ruby, so expect some language-learning related refacting to occur.

== Things that work

* most of an xinclude implementation
* a stub of an xpointer implementation

== Thanks that don't work

=== Xinclude
* xml:lang fix up
* namespace issues
* some text is left behind
* only file:/// URLs supported
* a trivial number and scope of unit tests

=== Xpointer
* pretty much everything
* a trivial number and scope of unit tests
