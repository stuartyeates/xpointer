xpointer
========

A ruby xpointer implementation

This is my first attemt to write ruby, so expect some language-learning related 
refacting to occur.

== Things that work

* most of an xinclude implementation
* a stub of an xpointer implementation

== Thanks that don't work

=== Xinclude
* xml:lang fix up
* namespace issues
* some text is left behind
* only file:/// URLs supported
* a trivial number and scope of unit tests

=== Xpointer
* pretty much everything
* a trivial number and scope of unit tests

== The Future ==

My plan is to give it up as too hard if I don't have the most complete xpointer 
suite within ~ two months. Also in that timeframe, I'll know whether ruby is a 
language I'm comfortable with.
